# Asteroid_Defenders

This was made as part of an online tutorial from TechWithTim. I have made many alterations and plan to continue development, but the base of the program is from his Youtube course, "Space Invaders with Pygame." He explains things very well and I recommend his content.

Future developments: Attacking ships. Health bars. Enemies explode upon defeat. Screen glow when new level starts. Sound effects. Boss levels. Powerups: Dual Cannons. Armor. AI partner.

I welcome any collaboration or critique.
